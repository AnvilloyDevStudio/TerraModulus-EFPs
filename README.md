# TerraModulus EFPs

## Execution Framework Proposals

**Execution Framework Proposals**, or EFPs, are the structured documents that outlline how
a project or initiative will be executed, managed, and monitored to achive its goals; or
explain or define a certain architecture which would be applied onto the project, including
its community.

An EFP may involve the community, an architecture, a plan or a scheme. It may not be highly
executive, but may involve certain objectives, deliverables, or boundaries of the project.
There may not be time constrains, but the milestones and objectives may be decided in the
roadmap. Moreover, it would be intended to standardize and guide the project or a process.
Sometimes, some EFPs may solicit feedback from the community depending on the context, so
EFPs may be updated and revised upon feedbacks or progressions. However, the topics or the
themes of the EFPs should not be changed, or else a new EFP should be issued for the new
content and updates. Certainly, detailed descriptions should always be included to ensure
the goals and methods are generally understood.

### Structure 

The entire EFP architecture is defined in EFP 1. An EFP includes the following sections:
